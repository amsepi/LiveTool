## AWS Deployment with Terraform

This project includes a Terraform configuration to automatically deploy the application to AWS.

### What is Terraform?

Terraform is an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool. Instead of manually clicking through the AWS console to create servers, networks, and security groups, you define all those resources in configuration files. This makes your infrastructure repeatable, version-controlled, and easy to manage.

### How to Deploy

Anyone who clones this repository can easily replicate the deployment by following these steps:

#### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need:

*   An AWS Account.
*   Terraform CLI installed on your local machine.
*   AWS CLI installed and configured (`aws configure`) with credentials for an IAM User.
*   An EC2 Key Pair created in your target AWS region. This is for SSH access.
*   The correct IAM Permissions for your user. The `AdministratorAccess` policy works but is not recommended for production. A custom policy is safer.

#### 2. Customize Variables

Inside the `livetool-deployment` directory, open `variables.tf`. If your AWS region or EC2 Key Pair name are different, you can change the `default` values in this file.

#### 3. Run Terraform

Navigate to the deployment directory and run the standard Terraform commands:

```sh
cd livetool-deployment

# Initializes Terraform and downloads the AWS provider
terraform init

# Provisions all the resources defined in the .tf files
terraform apply
```

After confirming with `yes`, Terraform will build the infrastructure. When it's done, it will output the public IP address of the server.

#### 4. Access the Application

Wait 5-10 minutes for the setup script to finish, then open your browser to `http://<public_ip>:8000`.

#### 5. Clean Up

To avoid ongoing AWS charges, you can destroy all the created infrastructure with a single command:

```sh
terraform destroy
```
